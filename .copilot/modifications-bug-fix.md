# Bug Fix Summary and Spinner Implementation

## Issue Identified
The `aifoundry_deep_client.py` file was failing with a `KeyError: -1` error during execution. The error occurred in the `create_research_summary` function.

## Root Causes
1. **Incorrect function call parameters**: Line 189 was passing `final_message` instead of `all_messages` to `create_research_summary()`
2. **Data type mismatch**: The `content` variable was defined as a list but being written as a string to the file
3. **Missing attributes**: The code was trying to access `id`, `role`, and `created_at` attributes on the custom `ResponseMessage` class, which doesn't have these properties

## Changes Made

### 1. Fixed function call parameters (Line 189)
**Before:**
```python
create_research_summary(final_message, total_time, run.usage)
```
**After:**
```python
create_research_summary(all_messages, total_time, run.usage)
```

### 2. Fixed content variable type (Line 62)
**Before:**
```python
content = [f"# All Output Items \n - Job Status: Complete\n - Total Time: {time_taken}\n - Token Usage:\n   - {token_metrics}\n\n"]
```
**After:**
```python
content = f"# All Output Items \n - Job Status: Complete\n - Total Time: {time_taken}\n - Token Usage:\n   - {token_metrics}\n\n"
```

### 3. Updated message iteration logic (Lines 68-82)
**Before:**
- Used object comparison `final_message != msg`
- Tried to access non-existent attributes like `msg.id`, `msg.role`, `msg.created_at`

**After:**
- Used index-based comparison `i < len(all_messages) - 1`
- Removed references to non-existent attributes
- Simplified message numbering with `Message {i + 1}:`

### 4. Created Terminal Spinner Class
**New File:** `/workspaces/deepresearch/src/terminal_spinner.py`

Features:
- Rotating character animation at the same cursor position
- Customizable spinner characters and messages
- Context manager support for automatic cleanup
- Multiple predefined spinner styles (dots, classic, arrows, bounce, simple, clock)
- Methods: `update()`, `stop()`, `__enter__()`, `__exit__()`

### 5. Integrated Spinner into Deep Research Process
**In `aifoundry_deep_client.py`:**
- Added import for `TerminalSpinner`
- Integrated spinner into the polling loop to show progress
- Displays current status updates
- Shows completion message when research finishes

## Impact
These changes ensure that:
- The function receives the correct data type (list of messages instead of single message)
- File writing operations work correctly with proper string content
- The code no longer tries to access attributes that don't exist on the custom `ResponseMessage` class
- The research summary generation completes successfully without errors
- Users get visual feedback during long-running deep research operations
- Better user experience with progress indication
