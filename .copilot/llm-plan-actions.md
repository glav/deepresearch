# Plan: Actions

## Phase 1: Implementation
- Task 1.1: Extract requires_action logic into a separate method
- Task 1.2: Update the main loop to call the new method
- Task 1.3: Ensure proper error handling and return values

## Phase 2: Validation
- Task 2.1: Verify code structure and readability improvements

## Checklist
- [x] Task 1.1: Extract requires_action logic into a separate method
- [x] Task 1.2: Update the main loop to call the new method
- [x] Task 1.3: Ensure proper error handling and return values
- [x] Task 2.1: Verify code structure and readability improvements

## Success Criteria - COMPLETED ✅
- ✅ The requires_action logic is extracted into a separate, well-named method (`process_required_actions`)
- ✅ The main polling loop is cleaner and more readable
- ✅ All existing functionality is preserved
- ✅ The new method has clear parameters and return values
- ✅ Error handling is maintained or improved
