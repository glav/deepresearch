# Actions Refactor Modifications

## Summary
Refactored the `requires_action` handling logic in `aifoundry_deep_client.py` by extracting it into a separate, reusable method.

## Changes Made

### 1. Created new method: `process_required_actions`
- **File**: `/workspaces/deepresearch/src/aifoundry_deep_client.py`
- **Purpose**: Handle all tool action processing logic
- **Parameters**:
  - `run`: The current agent run that requires action
  - `thread_id`: ID of the thread being processed
  - `agents_client`: The agents client for submitting tool outputs
- **Returns**: Number of tool outputs processed
- **Features**: Proper error handling, clear logging, and comprehensive tool call processing

### 2. Simplified main polling loop
- **File**: `/workspaces/deepresearch/src/aifoundry_deep_client.py`
- **Change**: Replaced ~40 lines of inline logic with a single method call
- **Before**: Large if block with nested logic for tool processing
- **After**: Clean `process_required_actions(run, thread.id, agents_client)` call

## Benefits
- **Improved Readability**: Main loop is now much cleaner and easier to follow
- **Better Maintainability**: Tool action logic is isolated and can be modified independently
- **Reusability**: The method can be reused in other parts of the codebase if needed
- **Separation of Concerns**: Tool processing logic is separated from the main polling logic

## Code Structure
The refactored code follows better software engineering practices:
- Single Responsibility Principle: Each method has one clear purpose
- Clean Code: Descriptive method names and clear parameter definitions
- Maintainability: Related functionality is grouped together

All existing functionality has been preserved while significantly improving code organization.
