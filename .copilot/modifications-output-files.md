# Modifications Summary: Output Files

## Overview
Modified the `do_research()` method in `deep_client.py` to create two output files instead of printing to console.

## Changes Made

### 1. Added Import
- Added `import os` for directory and file operations

### 2. Output Directory Creation
- Added programmatic creation of output directory using `os.makedirs(output_dir, exist_ok=True)`
- Directory path: `{project_root}/output/`

### 3. Data Collection Logic
- Replaced simple print statements with comprehensive data collection
- Created two lists: `all_items` for all output items, `reasoning_items` for reasoning-only items
- Added logic to handle different item types with proper formatting

### 4. File Generation
- **output_items.md**: Contains all items from `response.output` regardless of type
- **reasoning.md**: Contains only items of type 'reasoning'
- Both files include proper Markdown headers and formatting

### 5. User Feedback
- Added console output to inform user of file creation
- Shows full path to output directory and created files

## Files Modified
- `/workspaces/deepresearch/src/deep_client.py`

## Files Created
- `/workspaces/deepresearch/output/` (directory)
- Will create `output_items.md` and `reasoning.md` when method is executed

## Technical Details
- Uses `os.path.join()` for cross-platform path handling
- Includes proper UTF-8 encoding for file writing
- Handles various response item structures with `hasattr()` checks
- Maintains backward compatibility while enhancing functionality
