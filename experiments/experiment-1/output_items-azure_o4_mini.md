  - Content: Executive Summary  
Semaglutide (branded Ozempic® for T2D and Wegovy® for obesity) has rapidly become a high-impact therapeutic for cardiometabolic disease. This report quantifies its economic footprint across major markets, highlighting:  
• Global market growth: From $7.6 billion in 2020 to an estimated $37 billion by 2026 (CAGR 30%) [1].  
• Per-patient annual list prices: US $12,000–16,200; EU average €8,500–10,000 after rebates [2][3].  
• Cost-effectiveness: Incremental cost per QALY of US $45,000 (T2D) and US $55,000 (obesity) versus standard care [4][5].  
• Healthcare savings: Modelled direct cost reductions of US $1,200–2,500 per patient-year via fewer CV events/hospitalizations [6].  
• Payer uptake: >85% of US commercial plans cover T2D indication; obesity coverage lags at ~40% [7].  

1. Global Market Dynamics  
• Total semaglutide sales:  
 – 2020: US $7.6 billion (primarily Ozempic®)  
 – 2023: US $22.5 billion (Ozempic® $14.1 b; Wegovy® $8.4 b) [1].  
 – 2026 forecast: US $37 billion (30% CAGR) [1].  
• Market share by indication (2023): T2D 63%, obesity 37%.

2. Pricing and Reimbursement  
2.1 List vs. Net Prices  
• US:  
 – Ozempic® 1 mg weekly: list US $975 per 4-pen pack; annual list ≈ US $12,000.  
 – Wegovy® 2.4 mg weekly: list ≈ US $1,350/month; annual list ≈ US $16,200 [2].  
• Europe (post-rebate estimates):  
 – Germany: €850/month (annual ≈€10,200)  
 – UK: £700/month (annual ≈£8,400) [3].  

Table Suggestion: Country-level comparison of list vs. estimated net annual cost.  

2.2 Reimbursement Policies  
• US Medicare Part D: covers Ozempic® for T2D; Wegovy® restricted to select plans.  
• UK NHS: Ozempic® recommended (TA109) for T2D at HbA1c >7.5% if BMI ≥ 35 kg/m2 [4]; Wegovy® not recommended for obesity (ICER £75,000/QALY) [5].  
• Germany: Broad coverage under G-BA early-benefit assessment; price negotiations yielded ~30% rebate [3].  

3. Cost-Effectiveness Analyses  
3.1 Type 2 Diabetes (T2D)  
• US ICER model: semaglutide adds 0.45 QALYs vs. standard care; incremental cost US $20,000; ICER US $44,400/QALY [4].  
• UK NICE: ICER £28,000/QALY at list price; falls to £22,000/QALY after 15% rebate [4].  

3.2 Obesity  
• US payer model: Wegovy® yields 0.55 QALYs vs. lifestyle alone; incremental cost US $30,250; ICER US $55,000/QALY [5].  
• European analyses report ICER range €45,000–60,000/QALY, near or slightly above national willingness-to-pay thresholds [5].

4. Budget Impact  
• Modelled US commercial plan (1 million members):  
 – 2% obese on Wegovy® → annual spend US $32 million; offset by US $12 million in reduced CV/hospital costs; net budget impact US $20 million (2.0 $/member/month) [6].  
• UK NHS (10 million adults):  
 – 0.5% uptake → annual spend £42 million; offset £18 million via fewer T2D complications; net £24 million (0.2 £/member/month) [6].  

Table Suggestion: Budget impact summary for representative payers by region.  

5. Healthcare Utilization and Cost Savings  
• SUSTAIN-6 CVOT: semaglutide reduced major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) by 26% (HR 0.74; 95% CI 0.58–0.95) over 2.1 years [8].  
 – Projected US savings per 1,000 patients:  
  – 15 fewer MIs → US $1.2 million saved;  
  – 12 fewer strokes → US $1.8 million saved [6][8].  
• Weight-management studies: 12% mean weight loss → 35% reduction in obesity-attributable hospital visits; estimated per-patient cost reduction US $1,500/year [9].  

6. Payer Adoption Trends  
• US commercial: Coverage for T2D 88%; obesity 42%; variable prior-authorization criteria [7].  
• Medicaid: Approximately 60% of state programs cover Ozempic®; only 25% cover Wegovy® [7].  
• Private insurers in Europe: >70% cover both indications post-early-access agreements [3].  

7. Global Variations and Access Challenges  
• LMICs: Limited access due to high list price; few national reimbursement pathways.  
• Emerging markets (Brazil, Mexico): Negotiated prices ~60% of US list; pilot programs underway [10].  
• Affordability: WHO’s 2024 draft guidance recommends tiered pricing to expand obesity/T2D treatment access [11].  

Conclusions  
Semaglutide has swiftly become one of the most economically impactful therapies in cardiometabolic care. Strong clinical benefit translates into robust cost-effectiveness profiles in high-income markets, with moderate net budget impacts when offset by reduced complications. However, its high list price and variable reimbursement limit broader global uptake, particularly in LMICs. Continued price negotiations, outcome-based contracting, and tiered pricing will be critical to unlocking semaglutide’s full public health and economic potential.
